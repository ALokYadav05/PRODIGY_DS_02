# PRODIGY_DS_02
Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning on the Titanic dataset  to uncover survival trends and relationships between variables.


# Titanic Data Analysis and Cleaning 🚢

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Cleaning** on the classic Titanic dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The goal is to understand the data, clean it for further modeling, and discover patterns that may explain survival outcomes.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Files used:
  - `train.csv`
    
---

## ✨ Project Highlights

- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`, etc.
- Converted categorical features to numerical ones.
- Visualized survival patterns based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class (Pclass)
  - Age groups
  - Family size (SibSp + Parch)
  - Embarked location
- Correlation heatmap and survival rate bar plots.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Checked for nulls and missing values
- Filled or dropped missing data
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
- Removed outliers where necessary
- Feature engineering for better insights

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used Python libraries such as:

- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **SeaBorn** for visulization

Key visualizations:

- Survival rate vs Gender
- Age distribution of passengers
- Pclass vs Survival
- Heatmap of feature correlations
